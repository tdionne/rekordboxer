# Rekordboxer

This project was created to help sync metadata between streaming and downloaded tracks in a rekdorbox library.

## About

Boxer is an app that will search for streaming tracks in your rekordbox library, and match them with downloaded tracks. Very often DJs will create playlists with streaming tracks, but then have a need to download them for export to USB. In these cases, the streaming tracks have been decorated with metadata like rating, tags/comments, color, and queue points. Instead of being forced to duplicate this effort for the downloaded tracks, this application will allow a DJ to copy the metadata from the streaming track to the downloaded track.

## Deployments

Boxer is currently deployed to https://boxer.ruffrecordings.com

## Known Issues
It has become clear that streaming tracks and downloaded tracks are not identical, so beat grid and queue points can be off slightly.  I tried to find patterns in how the files are different, but they don't seem to be consistent.
